## Project Overview

*Condenado por Sanar* was born from the complex realities faced by medical professionals today. 
The song reflects the intense pressures doctors endure: threats from patients expecting miracles, judicial scrutiny, and the unfair generalization of all doctors under accusations of malpractice.  

In many regions, people increasingly rely on traditional remedies and avoid hospitals until all else fails, expecting miraculous interventions when they finally seek professional help. Hospitals are often overwhelmed, forcing patients to wait days in line and sometimes receive subpar care. Meanwhile, good doctors are trapped between these expectations and systemic challenges, facing threats, legal pressures, and the stigma created by the negligent few.  

This song seeks to humanize healthcare workers, highlighting their dedication, vulnerability, and the emotional toll of navigating a system where science, faith, and societal pressures collide. It is both a tribute to their perseverance and a commentary on the ethical and emotional dilemmas of modern medicine.
